      body: `Near the renowned Herzog August Library once stood the synagogue of the Jewish community in Lessingstraße. In November 1938, the National Socialists destroyed this impressive structure. Using architectural plans and historical photographs, a virtual reconstruction of the building has been created. The design was by the well-known Brunswick architect Konstantin Ude. Of particular note was the twin-tower façade, combining Oriental and Romanesque stylistic features. High above it rose the Tablets of the Law bearing the Ten Commandments – a characteristic element of Jewish houses of worship. Delicate architectural details linked towers and gables, giving the building a unique visual presence.

The new synagogue was solemnly inaugurated on 21 June 1893.

From the richly ornamented brick entrance façade, we move to the southern side. The colour palette of the brickwork was inspired by the nearly contemporary Jewish Free School, known as the Samson School. The new synagogue had become necessary because the previous one in Harzstraße had become too small. As we continue along the southern wall toward the eastern end of the building, an apse becomes clearly visible. Inside was the Torah Ark, where the valuable Torah scrolls were kept.

The shape of the apse could only be determined from photographs, which depict it as distinctly rounded. In contrast, the architect’s original drawings show a polygonal form. Differences between the design and the realised structure are also apparent in the windows. While the ground-floor windows in the drawings are rounded, the executed building features triangular forms. Consequently, the reconstruction had to rely more heavily on photographic evidence. The northern side, shown here, was often photographed because the undeveloped neighbouring site allowed an unobstructed view of the synagogue’s long side.

The Wolfenbüttel Synagogue was a Reform synagogue. Practically, this meant a shortened liturgy, partly in German, regular sermons, and the introduction of organ music. The organ in the Wolfenbüttel synagogue was located directly behind the large window in the entrance façade. Men and women likely entered the building together through this portal. The women then ascended a staircase to a gallery, while the ground floor was reserved for the men.

Before us stands the magnificent Torah Ark. Behind the red curtain were the precious Torah scrolls – handwritten parchment scrolls containing the Five Books of Moses, rolled onto two wooden staves. To this day, Torah scrolls are written by hand on parchment. The Ark was crowned by a semicircular dome. In front of it stood the Bimah, from which the Torah was read.

The view shown here was reconstructed from the only surviving image of the splendid interior. Along with architectural drawings – which do not depict the final execution – this photograph formed the basis for the reconstruction. The colour scheme is hypothetical and modelled on other synagogues of the period.

Looking upward, we see the gallery where the women sat. There were reportedly 84 seats available.

Our view now shifts westward. Compared to the previously mentioned photograph, the western part of the interior is only fragmentarily documented. Architectural plans provide some insight, but crucial information was derived from a photograph of the destroyed synagogue. It shows the western gallery with its painted balustrade, which served as the basis for reconstructing this area.

Here we see the view from the western gallery. Now let us examine the interior from the side gallery. The longitudinal orientation of the building becomes apparent. Typically, the Torah Ark – and thus the synagogue – is oriented toward Jerusalem. In Germany, this means the Ark is located on the eastern side, while the entrance lies on the western side. This was also the case in Wolfenbüttel.

Next, we observe the area around the Torah Ark from the women’s gallery. In Orthodox synagogues, the Bimah stands in the middle of the room. In Reform synagogues – as here – it is positioned in front of the Ark. Two steps lead to a raised platform that ends in the Torah niche. Seen from below, the niche reveals the Eternal Light hanging above the Bimah.

The elevated view toward the west gallery reveals the impressive organ. A historical drawing served as the model for the reconstructed instrument. Next to the organ is the choir, in which women also participated – another characteristic of Reform synagogues.

With this central perspective, we move – passing the Eternal Light – back to the ground floor. In the foreground is the Bimah; in the background, the western entrance.

Let us now take a closer look at the area where the men sat. Approximately 200 seats were available here. Finally, our gaze returns to the entrance.

For 45 years, Jewish men entered the synagogue through this portal – until the night of 9–10 November 1938, when the National Socialists destroyed the building. The interior was smashed, and the structure was set on fire with petrol. It burned down completely, leaving only the enclosing walls.

In 1933, the Jewish community counted 112 members; by 1939, only about 50 remained. They were deported by the National Socialists to extermination camps, where nearly all of them were murdered. With the final deportations on 16 March 1943, Jewish life in Wolfenbüttel came to an end. A new community did not re-emerge.

Today, a residential building stands on the site of the former synagogue. A memorial plaque commemorates it. Additionally, the Samson School Memorial and Educational Centre, recently inaugurated after extensive renovation, commemorates Jewish life in Wolfenbüttel. The former Jewish schoolhouse now houses a permanent exhibition, event spaces, and around 150 apartments for students and trainees. In this way, the building reconnects with Jewish traditions of enlightenment, education, and dialogue.

Finally, we turn once more to Lessingstraße. This is how it would appear today if the synagogue still stood. The virtual reconstruction presented by the Bürger-Museum aims to inspire – especially among younger visitors – an interest in exploring the Jewish history of the city through the media of the 21st century.`
